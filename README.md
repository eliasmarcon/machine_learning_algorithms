# Machine Learning Algorithms

This project includes various machine learning algorithms and their implementations. Each folder contains both a Python file with the implemented algorithm and an example Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use the implementation.

Here's a brief overview of the contents and structure of each folder:

## 1. Custom Train Test Split

- **Python File:** `data_splitting.py`

  - Contains a custom implementation of the train-test split functionality, providing an alternative to the built-in scikit-learn methods.

- **Example Notebook:** `example.ipynb`
  - Shows how to use the custom train-test split function with sample datasets.

## 2. Datasets

- **Files:** Various classical datasets in Excel/CSV format (e.g., diabetes).
  - Contains datasets for use with the provided algorithms. The datasets are available in Excel/CSV format and include commonly used datasets for machine learning tasks.

## 3. Decision & Regression Tree

- **Python File:** `decision_tree.py`

  - Implements the decision tree algorithm for classification tasks.

- **Python File:** `regression_tree.py`

  - Implements the regression tree algorithm. Please note that this implementation is not finished and is still a work in progress.

- **Example Notebook:** `example.ipynb`
  - Provides examples of training and evaluating decision and regression tree implementations.

## 4. K-Means

- **Python File:** `kmeans.py`

  - Contains an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm.

- **Example Notebook:** `example.ipynb`
  - Illustrates how to apply K-Means clustering to a dataset and visualize the clusters.

## 5. K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)

- **Python File:** `knn_classification.py`

  - Implements the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm specifically for classification tasks.

- **Python File:** `knn_regression.py`

  - Implements the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm specifically for regression tasks.

- **Example Notebook:** `example.ipynb`
  - Provides examples of using K-NN for both classification and regression problems.

## 6. Linear Regression

- **Python File:** `simple_linear_regression.py`

  - Contains an implementation of linear regression with methods for fitting and predicting.

- **Example Notebook:** `example.ipynb`
  - Demonstrates how to apply linear regression to a dataset and evaluate the results.

## 7. Neural Network (Not Finished)

- **Python File:** `neural_network.py`

  - The initial implementation of a neural network. This is a work in progress and may not be complete.

- **Python File:** `perceptron.py`

  - Implements a Perceptron algorithm, a simple type of neural network used for binary classification tasks.

- **Example Notebook:** `example.ipynb`
  - Includes examples of how to use the neural network and perceptron implementations. Note that the neural network implementation may be incomplete or subject to updates.

Each Python file includes detailed comments and documentation to help you understand the implementation, while the example notebooks provide practical demonstrations and usage scenarios.
